## Yield Farming

This project helps in staking of tokens using Yield Farming. The idea of yield farming is to incentivize users with passive income in exchange for providing liqudity in the pool.DeFi yield farming allows users to lock up their assets and earn rewards, often in the form of tokens or interest. Whether itâ€™s liquidity provision, staking, or lending, DeFi yield farming is a dynamic field with endless possibilities.


In this project we will create a Defi Yield Farming, that includes staking, unstaking and withdraw of rewards.
